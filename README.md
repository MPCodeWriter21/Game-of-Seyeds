🚀 Getting Started
------------------

To get started with the Game of Seyeds, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake
- Raylib (auto-fetched by CMake)
- cURL (auto-fetched by CMake)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MPCodeWriter21/Game-of-Seyeds.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Game-of-Seyeds
   ```

3. Build the project using CMake:
   You can simply run `cmake` and have your build files generated based on your
   operating system and configurations, or you could run a more specific command like this:

   ```bash
   # Create Unix Makefiles based on the CMake configuration in the current directory and
   # put them in the `build/` directory under the current working directory and use clang
   CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -S . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles"
   # OR
   cmake -S . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
   ```

   Then build it based on the files generated by CMake. If you used Makefile like I did,
   you can simply go to the `build/` directory and run `make`. Or on Windows you might
   choose to go with MSVC and do something like:

   ```powershell
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

### Running the Game

After building the project, you can simply run the output executable:

```bash
# Linux/Unix:
./GameOfSeyeds
```
