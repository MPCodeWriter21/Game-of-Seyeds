![GameOfSeyeds](https://github.com/MPCodeWriter21/Game-of-Seyeds/raw/master/screen-shots/menu.png)

A quiz game in which Seyed and others take turns to answer questions about several topics
and find the greatest of them all!

The questions are provided by the [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/).

What is in this repo?
---------------------

+ [x] A custom json parser.
+ [x] A simple interface to get questions from the Trivia API (Uses libcurl as backend).
+ [x] Immediate Mode GUI made with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
+ [x] CMakeLists.txt that can generate build files based on your setup and will download raylib and cURL automatically.
+ [x] Survival game with a difficulty choice and keeping track of games played and the highscore.
+ [ ] Multiplayer PvP game across different machines with sockets.

Build
-----

### Requirements

+ [CMake](https://cmake.org/): A build system to build the build files :)
+ Some compiler: You could consider using GCC, Clang or MSVC. Choose whichever suits
  you best.

### Run CMake and build the project

You can simply run `cmake` and have your build files generated based on your operating
system and configurations, or you could run a more specific command like this:

```bash
# Create Unix Makefiles based on the CMake configuration in the current directory and
# put them in the `build/` directory under the current working directory and use clang
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -S . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles"
# OR
cmake -S . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
```

Then build it based on the files generated by CMake. If you used Makefile like I did,
you can simply go to the `build/` directory and run `make`. Or on Windows you might
choose to go with MSVC and do something like:

```powershell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
